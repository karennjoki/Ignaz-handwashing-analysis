# Ignaz-handwashing-analysis
In the early 1800â€™s, many women passed away due to puerperal fever (commonly known as childbed fever) and Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, an assistant professor at John Hopkins 
School of Public Health, became interested in better understanding why this was the case.

Semmelweis began collecting data at two maternity clinics, one that was staffed solely by male doctors and medical students, with the other clinic staffed by female
midwives. Sammelweis suspected that a reason for the difference in mortality rate between the two clinics (as we will see below) is due to the simple act of 
handwashing.
